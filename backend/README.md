# Collaborative Realtime Workspace — Backend

The backend for the real-time collaborative workspace: a Node.js/Express service that hosts a **custom Yjs CRDT WebSocket server**, a REST API, and background workers — designed to run across multiple instances behind a load balancer.

---

## ✨ What it does

- **CRDT synchronization** — a custom Yjs WebSocket server (`crdt/WSServer.js`) implements the full `y-protocols` binary sync handshake. Incoming document deltas are merged into the shared `Y.Doc` and rebroadcast to all peers; conflicting edits resolve automatically without central locking.
- **Live presence** — the Yjs Awareness protocol broadcasts cursor positions, user metadata, and laser-pointer state to all peers on a board. Awareness states are cleaned up precisely per-connection on disconnect.
- **Horizontal scaling** — Yjs document deltas fan out across server instances via **Redis pub/sub** (`yjs:<boardId>` channel), so users connected to different Node processes stay in sync. Awareness frames relay over a parallel `awareness:<boardId>` channel (instance-id-prefixed to drop self-echoes), so cursors and presence work cross-instance too — including ghost-cursor cleanup when a peer on another instance disconnects.
- **Hardened write path** — client updates are validated before `Y.applyUpdate`: a 512 KB size cap and try/catch isolation so a malformed frame is logged and dropped instead of crashing the server. Pure-replay updates are handled natively by Yjs (idempotent via state vectors).
- **Write-behind persistence** — a **BullMQ** scheduler marks dirty docs every 30 seconds and enqueues persist jobs; a dedicated worker (concurrency 5) encodes and writes `Y.Doc` state to MongoDB. The dirty flag clears only after the job is durably enqueued, preventing silent data loss on crash.
- **History compaction** — Yjs docs grow monotonically (every erased shape leaves a tombstone; throttled drag writes leave per-key history chains), so `yjsState` bloats even at constant shape count. `DocumentManager` compacts on **room teardown** — when the last peer leaves — by replaying the doc's current logical values into a throwaway fresh doc and persisting *that* slim snapshot. Doing it at teardown means the rebuild never blocks a client's sync handshake (the room is empty) and the next cold load reads small, cheap-to-replay bytes. The savings on history-heavy docs are large — a synthetic board with a long per-key write chain compacted **68 KB → 5 KB (~93%)** in testing. Only persists the compacted form when it's ≤ 80% of the original; nested Y.Maps (votes, comments) are reconstructed rather than flattened so CRDT merge semantics survive a reload.
- **Authorization at the trust boundary** — `viewer`/`commenter`/`editor` roles are enforced **per Yjs sync message**, so a viewer cannot mutate a board even over a raw WebSocket.
- **Distributed rate limiting** — `express-rate-limit` + `rate-limit-redis` with shared Redis counters across instances, split into auth (50/15 min) / AI (40/15 min) / general (300/15 min) tiers.
- **Board-metadata cache** — access metadata (`owner`, `collaborators`, `isPublic`, `publicRole`, workspace members) is Redis-cached (`board:meta:<id>`, 60 s TTL) with explicit invalidation on share / unshare / publish / delete / leave, removing a cold MongoDB read from every WebSocket connection.
- **Self-service membership** — non-owner collaborators can leave a board (`DELETE /boards/leave/:id`) or a workspace (`DELETE /workspaces/:id/leave`, which also removes them from that workspace's boards); owners are rejected and must delete instead. Both paths invalidate the affected boards' metadata cache.
- **External API resilience** — Gemini calls wrapped with a 10 s timeout, exponential-backoff retries (transient errors only), and a shared circuit breaker (5 failure threshold, 30 s cooldown).
- **Health & readiness probes** — `GET /health` (MongoDB + Redis) and `GET /ready` (+ BullMQ workers running, persist-queue backpressure via `getWaitingCount`, and active-board count). `/ready` reports `not-ready` when the flush backlog exceeds the threshold so an orchestrator stops adding load until it drains.
- **Async board publishing** — BullMQ queue + worker generate a read-only public snapshot off the request path.
- **Graceful shutdown** — `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`/`SIGUSR2` drain workers, close queues, and quit Redis clients before process exit.
- **Auth** — email/password and Google OAuth 2.0, JWT access/refresh tokens. A custom-uploaded profile picture is never overwritten by a subsequent Google sign-in.

## 📦 Local Setup

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values. Key variables:

```env
PORT=3030

# MongoDB — full URI in DB_CLUSTER_URL, or split DB_USERNAME/DB_PASSWORD/DB_CLUSTER_URL
DB_USERNAME=your-db-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_CLUSTER_URL=cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net

# Redis — Yjs pub/sub, board-metadata cache, rate-limit store, BullMQ
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id

# Gemini (AI brainstorming)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

# Allowed frontend origin(s) for CORS (comma-separated)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

> See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list, including Cloudinary (media uploads) and SMTP (share-invite email).

### 3. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server starts on `PORT` (default `3030`). The Yjs WebSocket server is attached at the `/yjs` upgrade path on the same HTTP port.

## 🔭 Future Improvements

- **Incremental update log.** The persistence worker currently writes a full `Y.encodeStateAsUpdate` snapshot per flush, so a single element move can cause a large MongoDB write (write amplification). The planned replacement appends raw per-update chunks (20–200 bytes) to a `yjsUpdates` collection on each `ydoc.on('update')`, replays them in `seq` order on cold load, and compacts the log into a snapshot once it exceeds a threshold (~50 entries) — the same approach used by `y-leveldb` and Hocuspocus persistence adapters. Touches `DocumentManager.js` + `persistenceWorker.js` and adds a `YjsUpdate` Mongoose model.
