# Collaborative Realtime Workspace

<img width="1470" height="833" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ef5d47-9451-43d9-9345-0830f16b55ba" />

A full-stack, real-time collaborative workspace where teams ideate and organize on a shared, multi-page canvas — sticky notes, Kanban cards, connectors, polls, embeds, and more. State syncs conflict-free across clients with **Yjs CRDTs**, and the backend is built to run horizontally behind a load balancer: Redis-backed pub/sub, write-behind persistence, distributed rate limiting, health probes, and resilient external calls.

The canvas UI is **custom-built** (React + SVG, no canvas library), so the workspace is fully owned end-to-end — from the CRDT wire protocol on the server to every element on the screen.

## Highlights (Backend)

This project's emphasis is a backend that is safe to scale across multiple instances:

| Concern | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **CRDT sync engine** | A custom Yjs WebSocket server (`backend/crdt/WSServer.js`) attached to the HTTP server at `/yjs/<boardId>`. Implements the full `y-protocols` binary sync handshake, merges incoming deltas, and rebroadcasts to peers — conflicts resolve automatically via CRDTs, no central locking. |
| **Horizontal scaling** | Yjs document deltas fan out across instances via **Redis pub/sub** (`yjs:<boardId>` channel), so users on different Node processes stay in sync behind a load balancer. |
| **Write-behind persistence** | A **BullMQ** scheduler + worker flush in-memory `Y.Doc` state to MongoDB every 30 seconds (`backend/crdt/persistenceWorker.js`), keeping the hot sync path off the database. Dirty-flag is cleared only after the job is durably enqueued — no silent data loss on crash. |
| **History compaction** | On cold load, `DocumentManager` compacts the Y.Doc by replaying logical values into a fresh doc, dropping accumulated CRDT tombstones. Runs only when the compacted form is ≥ 20% smaller than the original; nested Y.Maps (votes, comments) are reconstructed, not flattened. |
| **Authorization at the trust boundary** | Roles (`viewer`/`commenter`/`editor`) are enforced **per Yjs sync message**, not just at connect. A `viewer`'s write bytes are discarded before touching the shared doc — a hand-crafted WebSocket frame can't bypass the UI's read-only mode. |
| **Distributed rate limiting** | `express-rate-limit` + `rate-limit-redis` with shared counters in Redis across all instances, split into auth / AI / general API tiers (`backend/middleware/rateLimiters.js`). |
| **Board-metadata cache** | Access metadata (`owner`, `collaborators`, `isPublic`, `publicRole`, workspace members) is cached in Redis (`board:meta:<id>`, 60 s TTL) and explicitly invalidated on share / unshare / publish / delete — removing a cold MongoDB read from every WebSocket connection (`backend/cache/boardCache.js`). |
| **External API resilience** | Gemini calls are wrapped with a 10 s timeout, exponential-backoff retries (3 attempts, transient errors only), and an in-memory circuit breaker (opens after 5 consecutive failures, half-opens after 30 s cooldown) — an upstream outage fails fast instead of queuing hanging requests (`backend/utils/resilience.js`). |
| **Health & readiness probes** | `GET /health` checks live MongoDB + Redis (`503` when down); `GET /ready` additionally verifies BullMQ workers are running — concrete signals for load balancers and orchestrators. |
| **Async publishing** | A BullMQ queue + worker produces a read-only public snapshot of a board off the request path (`backend/jobs/`). |
| **Graceful shutdown** | `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` drain BullMQ workers, close queues, and quit Redis clients before process exit. |

## Features (Product)

- **Multi-page canvas** of fixed 16:9 slides with freeform / grid / column layout modes.
- **Rich elements:** sticky notes, Kanban cards (labels, assignees, subcards, due dates), text boxes, connectors, poll blocks, iframe embeds, shapes, and media.
- **Live presence:** real-time teammate cursors with name tags and a laser pointer, broadcast via Yjs Awareness.
- **Comments & voting** on elements for async decision-making.
- **Role-based sharing** (Viewer / Commenter / Editor) and public board publishing.
- **AI brainstorming** via the Google Gemini API.
- **Secure auth** with email/password and Google OAuth 2.0 (JWT access/refresh).

## Tech Stack

**Backend** — Node.js, Express, Yjs (`y-protocols`, `y-websocket`, `ws`), MongoDB/Mongoose, Redis (pub/sub, cache, rate-limit store), BullMQ + ioredis, JWT + Google OAuth 2.0, Google Gemini API.

**Frontend** — React 19, Vite, custom SVG canvas, Yjs + `y-websocket`, Tailwind CSS, React Router.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- A MongoDB instance
- A Redis instance
- Google OAuth credentials and a Gemini API key (for auth + AI features)

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` and talks to the backend on `http://localhost:3030`.
